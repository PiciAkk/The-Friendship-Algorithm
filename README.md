# The Friendship Algorithm in JavaScript

## Original:

I'm a big fan of [The Big Bang Theory](http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_bang_theory/) and I couldn't resist playing around with Sheldon's friendship algorithm. It's pretty much one object represented as ```Sheldon``` guided by the module pattern (thanks to [Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript)).

## Fork:

Hello! I'm PiciAkk, and I'm a big fan of [The Big Bang Theory](http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_bang_theory). One day I was reminded of Sheldon's friendship algorithm, and I looked at Google for images of the algorithm. After some search I found this [repository](https://github.com/marklreyes/The-Friendship-Algorithm), and I tought I could develop this code a little bit. Then I started to make it NodeJS-compatible. When I made it NodeJS-compatible, I started to update the code base. First, I added Sheldon's interests.
